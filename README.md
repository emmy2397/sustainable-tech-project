# sustainable-tech-project

A questionnaire where you put in information about a product (category) you consider buying and gives you advice on whether you should make that purchase. If you do not buy the product, it will show you how much in carbon footprint you saved. Also, the web application will create a motivational graphic to share and celebrate with family and friends. If you prefer to buy the product anyways you can start a 30-day timer to have enough time to reconsider your purchase and thus, avoid impulsive buying behaviour.
