            <p>Consumescape tries to help you when you are faced with the decision to buy something new. Forget times where you could not concentrate on your work because you were stuck contemplating on whether you really need those new shoes or whether you should splurge on buying the latest camera or newest smartphone. Consumescape combines the words to <strong>consume</strong> and <strong>escape</strong>, because we believe that it is truly possible to escape the consuming cycle we may find ourselves in by taking some time in the decision process. This is based on the principle of the 30 day rule, a technique that was mainly introduced to save money.</p>
                <h2 class="about-page-h2">This is how it works:</h2>
            <p>Instead of giving in to buying something impulsively, you back out and wait for 30 days. If you are still convinced that you need to buy that product after 30 days have passed, you'll probably won't regret buying it afterwards. If on the other hand you haven't spent a minute thinking something like "oh man, it would be really cool if I would have this right now, I can't wait to use it after these 30 days have passed" then we congratulate you for saving money, and most importantly ressources that are used to build this product, and saving the waste that it would have created once it won't be used anymore.
            In summary, it just takes a little time and patience to make a little decision that could have a great impact on yourself <em>and</em> the environment. <br>
            But because it takes up a lot of mental load just to remember that we wanted to think about buying something, we implemented a timer after our questionnaire so that we will take care of that for you, and you can go on in living your life without any worries related to your buying behavior.</p>
